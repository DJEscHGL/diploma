Ansys Fluent is a general-purpose computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software used to model fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, chemical reactions, and more. Fluent offers a modern, user-friendly interface that streamlines the CFD process from pre- to post-processing within a single window workflow. Fluent is known for its advanced physics modeling capabilities, which include turbulence modeling, single and multiphase flows, combustion, battery modeling, fluid-structure interaction, and much more.

Also known for its efficient HPC scaling, large models can easily be solved in Fluent on multiple processors on either CPU or GPU. Multiple solver options are available, including pressure-based and density-based CPU solvers to cover low-speed to hypersonic flows and a pressure-based native GPU solver.
