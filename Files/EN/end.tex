In this paper, various methods for modeling turbulent flows, their advantages and disadvantages are studied, and performance is also evaluated. In addition, methods for constructing a grid model were studied and an optimal scheme for working on it was created.

As a result of the channel simulation in Ansys Fluent, the influence on the boundary layer was estimated by modeling large eddies. Due to the placement of the vortex generator across, a turbulent mode of motion was formed. These vortex structures significantly affected local friction and transport.
